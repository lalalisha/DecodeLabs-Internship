# 🤖 RuleBot — Rule-Based Chatbot

A lightweight, zero-dependency chatbot built entirely with Python if-else logic and keyword matching. No machine learning, no APIs, no internet required — just pure Python rules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external libraries needed

### Run the chatbot

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rulebot.git
cd rulebot
python rulebot.py
```

That's it. No `pip install`, no `.env` file, no setup.

### Example session

```
==================================================
       RuleBot — Rule-Based Chatbot
==================================================
Hello! I'm RuleBot. Type 'help' to see what
I can do, or 'bye' to exit.
--------------------------------------------------
You: hello
RuleBot: Hey there! Great to see you. Type 'help' to see what I can do.

You: tell me a joke
RuleBot: Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
→ Because light attracts bugs!

You: what time is it
RuleBot: Right now it's 03:45 PM on Tuesday, June 23, 2026.

You: bye
RuleBot: Farewell! My if-else statements will miss you.
```

## 🔧 How It Works

RuleBot uses a simple two-step process:

1. **Normalize** — convert the user's input to lowercase and strip whitespace.
2. **Match** — scan through a list of rule dictionaries. Each rule has a `keywords` list and a `responses` list. The first rule whose keyword appears anywhere in the input wins, and a random response from that rule is returned.

```python
for rule in RULES:
    if any(kw in text for kw in rule["keywords"]):
        return random.choice(rule["responses"]), False
```

Special cases (exit keywords, live time/date) are checked before the rule table.

## ➕ Adding New Rules

Open `rulebot.py` and append a new dictionary to the `RULES` list:

```python
{
    "keywords": ["pizza", "food", "hungry", "eat"],
    "responses": [
        "I can't order pizza for you, but I highly recommend it!",
        "Food talk! My favourite topic (hypothetically).",
    ],
},
```

Save and re-run — no restart script needed.
